          <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most distinctive features of Silent Witness is its focus
            on the post mortem process. The pathologists spend much of their
            time in the Lyell Centre's laboratory, so a huge amount of effort is
            spent ensuring this aspect of the series is as intriguing and
            authentic as possible.
